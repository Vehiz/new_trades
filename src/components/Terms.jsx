      <h2>2. OUR SERVICES</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Mining Hardware, Services, and Pool</h3>
      <p>
        Our cryptocurrency mining hardware (referred to as “the Mining
        Hardware”) includes specialized computing equipment, software, network
        interconnectivity, and associated facilities that run proprietary
        cryptocurrency mining software (“the Software”). Through our services,
        we provide you with access to a specific volume of processing power
        (“the Service” or “the Services”) of this Mining Hardware. The
        processing power, measured in calculations per second (“Hashes”), is
        specified in each order. While there is potential for earnings, these
        are not guaranteed. We rent the Mining Hardware to deliver Services to
        you and other users (“Users”) and also utilize it ourselves.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2 Mining Contracts</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>a.</strong> When you enter into this Agreement, empowering us to
        provide the Service, and we accept your request by issuing an order
        confirmation (“the Order Confirmation”), a contract is formed (“the
        Mining Contract”). This contract allows us to allocate a portion of the
        Mining Hardware, corresponding to a specified level of computational
        power (“Mining Contract Capacity”), to you for cryptocurrency mining.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>b.</strong> The available types of Mining Contracts, including
        their terms and conditions, are described in detail on{" "}
        <a href="https://blocktrademine.com">Blocktrademine.com</a>. Please note
        that a Mining Contract purchase is required to access the Services and
        any resulting product rights.
      </p>
      <h3>2.3 Rental of Mining Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        We rent the Mining Hardware to provide Services to you and our other
        Users, including customers with current and valid Mining Contracts, and
        also for our own use. By executing this Agreement and reserving the
        Mining Contract, you agree to undertake cryptocurrency mining on your
        behalf, at your own risk, and for your own benefit. By allocating Mining
        Contract Capacity to you, we commit to making commercially reasonable
        efforts to rent the Mining Hardware on your behalf, partially on behalf
        of our other Users, and partially for ourselves. Any portion of the
        Mining Hardware not allocated through Mining Contracts is retained for
        our own benefit.
      </p>
      <h3>2.4 Mining Product</h3>
      <p>
        The Mining Hardware will mine cryptocurrency by utilizing Hashing Power.
        The cryptocurrency produced by the Mining Hardware (“the Product”) will
        be centrally collected by us, and a portion of the Product will be
        distributed to Users (“Customer Portion”) based on the Mining Contract
        Capacity allocated under valid Mining Contracts. Distribution may be
        subject to Maintenance or other Fees as outlined in the selected tariff
        plan.
      </p>
      <h3>2.5 Distribution of Product Portions</h3>
      <p>Customer Portions will be distributed to your Wallet.</p>
      <h3>2.6 Service Fee</h3>
      <p>
        The fee that you pay for the Mining Contract, as described on the Site.
      </p>
      <h3>2.7 Maintenance Fees</h3>
      <p>
        A daily fee may be charged from your Customer Portion to cover the
        running costs of Mining Hardware. This fee will be converted to Bitcoin
        based on the previous day’s Bitcoin closing price in USD published on{" "}
        <a href="https://www.coinmarketcap.com">CoinMarketCap</a>.
        Blocktrademine can adjust the maintenance fee with 7 days&apos; notice.
      </p>
      <h3>2.8 Fixed Daily Fee</h3>
      <p>
        If you have no active Mining Contracts for over 30 calendar days and a
        positive BTC balance on your Account on the Blocktrademine.com website,
        a fixed daily fee of 0.0137% (~5% annually, but no less than 0.00000685
        BTC) is charged on your BTC balance. To avoid the daily fee, you can
        activate a new BTC Mining Contract on the website.
      </p>
      <h3>2.9 Termination</h3>
      <p>
        Any allocated Mining Contract Capacity may be terminated if, for 72
        consecutive hours, the Customer Portions related to such Mining Contract
        Capacity are less than the maintenance fee. You may avoid termination by
        making arrangements to fund the maintenance fee if Customer Portions are
        insufficient.

        industrial action by third parties, civil commotion, riot, invasion,

      </p>
      <h3>14.3. Effect.</h3>
      <p>
        If a Force Majeure circumstance affects the performance of our
        obligations to deliver Services, (a) we will contact you as soon as
        reasonably possible to notify you; and (b) our obligations to you will
        be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be
        extended for the duration of the Force Majeure circumstances. Where the
        Force Majeure circumstance affects our delivery of Services to you for a
        period of greater than six months (referred to as the “Extended Force
        Majeure Circumstance”) we shall have sole discretion to cease provision

        We are also entitled, during the Force Majeure circumstance, to allocate

        of the Services with 7 days notice via internal email.
      </p>
      <h2>15. HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES ABOUT THE SERVICES?</h2>
      <h3>15.1. General.</h3>
      <p>
        YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER, CONCERNING, OR
        RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SERVICES), ITS INTERPRETATION,
        ITS VALIDITY (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT
        IS VOID OR VOIDABLE), ITS TERMINATION, OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, THE
        MARKETING OR PURCHASE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        SERVICE, WHETHER THEY ARE WITH US OR ANY OF OUR SUPPLIERS (TO THE EXTENT
        NOT WAIVED, AS SET FORTH ABOVE) ONLY BY MANDATORY, FINAL, BINDING
        ARBITRATION. THAT MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR
        JURY, SINCE THERE IS NONE IN ARBITRATION. IN ARBITRATION, THE PROCEDURES
        MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IN COURT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME
        DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS
        A COURT WOULD. YOU AGREE THAT IN SOME CASES, THE LAW PERMITS THE
        PREVAILING PARTY TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ITS ATTORNEYS FEES, AND THE SAME
        APPLIES TO DISPUTES THAT YOU RAISE IN ARBITRATION.
      </p>
      <h3>15.2. Arbitration of Disputes. </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Any controversy, claim, or dispute (“Dispute”) arising under,
        concerning, or relating to this Agreement (including any Services), its
        interpretation, its validity (including any claim that all or any part
        of this Agreement is void or voidable), its termination, or its subject
        matter, the marketing or purchase of the Service or any use or inability
        to use the Service, whether the Dispute is with us or any or any
        Supplier (to the extent not waived, as set forth above), whether the
        Dispute is for breach of contract, tort, or any other matter can only be
        resolved or adjudicated only by mandatory, final, binding arbitration.
      </p>
      <h3>15.3. Raising a Dispute. </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        To raise a Dispute, you must give us a notice of the Dispute by sending
        an e-mail to support@Blocktrademine.com with the words “RAISING A
        DISPUTE” in the subject line), along with a written description of your
        Dispute, including any documents and information that you believe will
        help us to understand your Dispute, and your requested resolution. In
        order to discuss the Dispute with you, you permit us (or the Disputed
        party) to contact you by phone, text message, email or physical mail
        through any and all addresses or phone numbers that you have provided.
        You must send us notice of any Dispute within 30 days of your
        discovering the act or omission that gave rise to your Dispute. If you
        do not so notify us, then you lose your right to raise the Dispute.
      </p>
      <h3>15.4. Resolution Offer. </h3>
      <p>
        Within the first 30 days after you submitted your Dispute, we will have
        the right, but no obligation, to provide you with a proposed resolution
        of the Dispute (hereinafter referred to as “the Offer”). If you are
        unsatisfied with the Offer, you must reject the Offer by giving us the
        notification within 14 days from the date of the Offer. If you do not
        reject the Offer within the 14-day period, you will be deemed to have
        accepted it and forfeit your right to raise the Dispute. If we do not
        make the Offer within 30 days after you submitted your Dispute or if you
        reject an Offer as set forth above, either you or we may commence the
        arbitration of the Dispute as set forth below.
      </p>
      <h3>15.5. Place and Language.</h3>
      <p>
        The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the English language,
        in the Republic of Ireland. We shall choose the arbitration service to
        be used for the Dispute.
      </p>
      <h3>15.6. Award.</h3>
      <p>
        Any award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall state the
        reasons for the award. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any
        court having competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator must
        be based upon this Agreement and applicable Law. The decision of the
        arbitrator is final and binding except for fraud, misconduct, or errors
        of law, and judgment upon the decision rendered may be entered in any
        court having jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <h3>15.7. Waiver of Rights</h3>
      <p>
        IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE. IT PROVIDES
        THAT YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THROUGH
        ARBITRATION, EVEN IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT.
        YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHTS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE A
        JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR
        SIMILAR PROCEEDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO
        COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE ARBITRATOR&apos;S AWARD, MIGHT
        NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR MIGHT BE MORE LIMITED. YOU SHOULD
        CONSULT THE LEGAL COUNSEL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE
        IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU OR NOT. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE
        WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT
        TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN
        DISCOVERY (EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE ARBITRATION RULES), AND TO
        PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A
        DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
        ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT
        PROCEDURES. YOU ALSO AGREE ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE
        DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY AND WILL NOT BE PART OF A CLASS-WIDE
        OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. 15.8. NO CLASS ACTIONS. EVEN IF
        THE APPLICABLE LAW, OR THE ARBITRATOR OTHERWISE PERMITS CLASS ACTIONS OR
        CLASS ARBITRATIONS, THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SPECIFIED HERE
        APPLIES AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS
        – THAT IS – TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR
        ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF
        ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.
      </p>

        against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those
        obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in
        writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any
        later default by you.
      </p>
      <h3>16.8. Conflict.</h3>
      <p>
        If there is a conflict between this Agreement and something stated by
